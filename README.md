# Hour_Logger

When I had a plethora of time at the beginning of the semester, decided to try and make a little script, 
(and have it evolve into an iOS app) so submit work hours outside the annoying Bannar system that Drexel uses. Fun little
project that had me fiddling with HTTP Requests and cookies.
